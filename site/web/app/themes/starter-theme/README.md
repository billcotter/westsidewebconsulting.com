## About Starter

Starter is a project by Calvin Koepke, a frontend designer currently working at Rainmaker Digital.
The goal of the project is to create a starter theme for Genesis Framework developers that doesn't over-bloat
their starting base, while including commonly used templates, codes, and styles, and which optionally includes Gulp development tasks.

## Credits and Licensing
Starter was created by Calvin Koepke, and is under the MIT license. You just need to include credit somewhere in your code.
